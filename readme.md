Discovering security vulnerabilities is essential, but estimating the associated risk to the business is critical. One may identify security vulnerabilities in any IT solution's architecture, design, source code review, or penetration testing. 

This "Technical Vulnerability Risk Calculator" will allow security professionals to estimate the probability of a specific vulnerability being discovered and exploited and estimate the magnitude of the impact on the system if the vulnerability were to be exploited in line with areas of concern; confidentiality, integrity, availability, and traceability. This vulnerability risk calculation is a qualitative assessment that takes less time and resources than quantitative analysis.

The vulnerability risk calculator saves time and clarifies priorities. The calculator will help ensure that organizations are not distracted by Low risks while ignoring Severe or Significant risks that stakeholders may not understand. 

Disclaimer: This calculator is inspired by OWASP's Risk Rating Methodology which does not include "Threat Agent Factors" and "Business Impact Factors" as organizations require an enhanced Threat Intelligence capability and a mature Configuration Management Database (CMDB) to use the publicly available OWASP Risk Rating Calculator.
