Discovering security vulnerabilities is essential, but estimating the associated risk to the business is critical. One may identify security vulnerabilities in any IT solution's architecture, design, source code review, or penetration testing. This calculator will allow security professionals to estimate the probability of a specific vulnerability being discovered and exploited and estimate the magnitude of the impact on the system if the vulnerability were to be exploited in line with areas of concern; confidentiality, integrity, availability, and traceability. This vulnerability risk calculation is a qualitative assessment that takes less time and resources than quantitative analysis.
